# Agent Guide: Writing "Cybersecurity Culture Transformed"

## Purpose

This guide provides comprehensive specifications for writing the remaining chapters of "Cybersecurity Culture Transformed" in a consistent, high-quality style that blends Michael Lewis narrative journalism with subtle African philosophy.

## Style Guidelines

### Michael Lewis Narrative Journalism Style

**Core Principles:**
- **Story First**: Every section begins with a compelling narrative hook—a real scenario, a specific person making a decision, a concrete moment in time
- **Character-Driven**: Focus on people, not abstract concepts. Show decisions being made, not just theories being explained
- **Data Storytelling**: Weave statistics and research into narrative, not as dry lists. Make numbers tell a story
- **Accessible Expertise**: Explain complex ideas through analogy, metaphor, and story. Never assume prior knowledge
- **Pacing**: Alternate between narrative scenes and explanatory passages. Keep the reader engaged through variety

**Writing Techniques:**
- Open each major section with a vivid scene or metaphor
- Use specific, concrete examples (not generic ones)
- Include real-world case studies with specific details
- Create narrative tension: show problems before solutions
- Use active voice and strong verbs
- Vary sentence length for rhythm

### African Philosophy Integration

**Approach:**
- Weave proverbs naturally into the text (3-5 per chapter)
- Use African metaphors (rivers, fires, communities, elders, baobab trees, Kente cloth)
- Frame wisdom through oral tradition and communal knowledge
- Respect for human nature: work with it, not against it
- Never force African elements; they should enhance, not distract

**Proverb Integration Guidelines:**
- Use proverbs to introduce concepts, reinforce points, or provide wisdom
- Always provide context or explanation if the meaning isn't immediately clear
- Vary the sources (Akan, Swahili, Zulu, Ubuntu, etc.)
- Don't overuse; quality over quantity

**Metaphor Guidelines:**
- Draw from African traditions naturally
- Connect metaphors to cybersecurity concepts
- Use metaphors consistently throughout the book (e.g., "building banks to guide the river")
- Ensure metaphors are accessible to all readers

### Voice and Tone

**Voice Characteristics:**
- Authoritative but accessible
- Respectful of readers' intelligence
- Engaging and conversational without being casual
- Practical and actionable
- Humble and learning-oriented

**Tone Guidelines:**
- Never condescending or preachy
- Avoid fear-mongering; focus on empowerment
- Balance seriousness with hope
- Use "we" and "us" to create connection
- Acknowledge complexity without overwhelming

- If content requires slightly more words to be complete, prioritize quality

### Case Study Requirements

**Each Chapter Should Include:**
- 2-3 real-world case studies

5. Extract the lesson

### Academic Citation Standards

**Requirements:**
- Minimum 8-10 references per chapter
- Use Harvard referencing style (consistent with existing chapters)
- Mix of foundational works and recent research
- Include behavioral science, cybersecurity, and organizational psychology sources
- Cite sources naturally within narrative, not as interruptions

**Reference Format:**
- Author, A. (Year). *Title*. Publisher.
- Author, A., & Author, B. (Year). Article title. *Journal Name*, Volume(Issue), pages.

### African Proverb Integration

**Guidelines:**
- 3-5 proverbs per chapter
