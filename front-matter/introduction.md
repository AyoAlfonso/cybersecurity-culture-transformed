# **Introduction**

There is a Nigerian proverb that says, 

*“When the roots are deep, there is no reason to fear the wind.”*

This book is, in many ways, the story of my roots—and of the storms that shaped me.

My career has taken me across very different but interconnected worlds. As Director of Information Protection and Compliance at **Age UK**, I was tasked with protecting some of the most sensitive data in the charity sector—ensuring that trust, once given by donors and beneficiaries, was never broken. As the Founder of **Seidea**, I built programmes to bring underrepresented talent into cybersecurity, learning that resilience is not only technical but social: it grows stronger when more voices are included. Today, as the CTO and Co-founder of **Souk**, I stand at the frontier of building secure systems for the next generation of AI-driven enterprises. And through my **PhD research at Royal Holloway**, I have studied how surveillance reaches into the most intimate corners of people’s lives, reminding me that security is never abstract; it is always human.

Each chapter of my journey has revealed the same truth: technology alone cannot hold us.

For decades, organisations have invested in firewalls, encryption, and compliance checklists, believing they would make us safe. And yet, time and again, I witnessed breaches that did not happen because the systems failed, but because culture did. A password written on a sticky note. A warning ignored because employees feared being blamed. Silence, where there should have been trust. These were not technical gaps—they were human ones.

I wrote this book now because the urgency has never been greater. The digital landscape is shifting under our feet. Artificial intelligence has supercharged attacks. Our work, once confined to offices, is now scattered across continents, devices, and clouds. The perimeter no longer exists. The attack surface is everywhere—and so are we.

What I have learned, from boardrooms to classrooms, is that the real differentiator is not the newest tool but the oldest wisdom: people. When nurtured, trusted, and empowered, they become the most adaptive line of defence. When ignored or blamed, they become the silent cracks that adversaries exploit. This book is important because it shifts the lens. It is not a manual about systems; it is a guide about culture. It argues that security is not an IT expense, but a leadership responsibility. That culture is not soft, but strategic. And that resilience is built in the same way it has always been—in the roots, not the branches.

So as you read, I invite you to see yourself not as a passive actor in this story but as one of its weavers. The chapters that follow will offer metaphors, research, and practical frameworks. But more than that, they will offer a new narrative: one where security is not driven by fear, but by trust. One where every individual—whether a board member, a developer, or a frontline worker—is recognised as a vital root in the tree of resilience.
